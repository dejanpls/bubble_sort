# Bubble Sort

## A Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort#project-solution">TOP Ruby Course</a>

Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY">this video</a> if you need more info on what a Bubble Sort is.

### How it works

* A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. 
* These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted.
